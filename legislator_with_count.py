"""
This script processes vote result data to count the number of bills each legislator supported or opposed.
It reads data from CSV files containing legislators and vote results, updates the vote counts per legislator,
and then writes the updated data to a new CSV file.

Steps:
    1. Parse legislators and vote results from input CSV files.
    2. Tally the number of supported and opposed bills for each legislator.
    3. Write the updated legislator records to an output CSV file.

Input:
    - input/legislators.csv: List of legislators.
    - input/vote_results.csv: List of vote results.

Output:
    - output/legislators-support-oppose-count.csv: Legislators with updated support and opposition counts.
